# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm **Ertannur**, <br>
a passionate educator and aspiring web developer with a unique blend of experience in music education and programming. As a dedicated music teacher, Iâ€™ve spent years fostering creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration in the classroom. Now, Iâ€™m channeling that same passion into building innovative web applications designed to enhance learning experiences in schools and educational settings.

ðŸ’» My journey into programming began with a desire to create tools that make education more engaging, accessible, and effective. I specialize in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m particularly interested in developing web apps that integrate interactive learning, gamification, and multimedia elements to support teachers and students alike.

ðŸŽ¶ My background in music education has taught me the importance of clear communication, adaptability, and user-centered designâ€”skills I now apply to my coding projects. Whether itâ€™s designing intuitive interfaces or crafting interactive features, I aim to create solutions that are both functional and inspiring.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge in full-stack development and exploring ways to bridge the gap between technology and education. Iâ€™m also passionate about contributing to open-source projects that empower educators and learners worldwide.

ðŸš€ When Iâ€™m not coding or teaching, you can find me exploring countries I haven't been to or working on my Spanish skills as my fifth language. I believe that creativity and technology go hand in hand, and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to combine the two.

ðŸ“« Letâ€™s connect and collaborate! Whether youâ€™re an educator, developer, or just someone who shares my passion for innovation in education, Iâ€™d love to hear from you:
